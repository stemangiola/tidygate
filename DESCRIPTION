Description: 
  tidygate allows you to interactively gate points on a scatter plot. Interactively drawn gates are 
  recorded and can be applied programmatically to reproduce results exactly. Programmatic gating is 
  based on the package gatepoints by Wajid Jawaid (who is also an author of this package).
