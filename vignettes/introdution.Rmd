## Introduction 

tidygate allows you to interactively gate points on a scatter plot. Interactively drawn gates are recorded and can be applied programmatically to reproduce results exactly. Programmatic gating is based on the package [gatepoints](https://github.com/wjawaid/gatepoints) by Wajid Jawaid. 

For more tidy data analysis:

- [tidyHeatmap](https://github.com/stemangiola/tidyHeatmap) - Produce heatmaps with tidy principles.

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# From Github
devtools::install_github("stemangiola/tidygate")

# From CRAN
install.package("tidygate")
```

## Example usage 

tidygate provides a single user-facing function: `gate`. The following examples make use of this function, four packages from the tidyverse and the inbuilt `mtcars` dataset. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(tidygate)

mtcars |>
  head()
```

By default, `gate` creates an interactive scatter plot based on user-defined X and Y coordinates. Colour, shape, size and alpha can be defined as constant values, or can be controlled by values in a specified column. 

Once the plot has been created, multiple gates can be drawn with the mouse. When you have finished, click continue. `gate` will then return a vector of strings, recording the gates each X and Y coordinate pair is within.

```{r eval=FALSE}
mtcars_gated <- 
  mtcars |>
  mutate(gated = gate(x = mpg, y = wt, colour = disp))
```

![](../man/figures/demo_gate.gif)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("../data/demo_gate_data.rda")

# Load pre-recorded brush path from data for example
tidygate_env <<- rlang::env()
tidygate_env$gates <- demo_gate_data

mtcars_gated <- 
  mtcars |>
  mutate(gated = gate(x = mpg, y = wt, programmatic_gates = tidygate_env$gates))
```

To select points which appear within any gates, filter for non-NA values. To select points which appear within a specific gate, string pattern matching can be used.

```{r}
# Select points within any gate
mtcars_gated |> 
  filter(!is.na(gated))

# Select points within gate 2
mtcars_gated |>
  filter(str_detect(gated, "2"))
```

Details of the interactively drawn gates are saved to `tidygate_env$gates`. This variable is overwritten each time interactive gates are drawn, so save it right away if you would like to access it later.  

```{r}
# Inspect previously drawn gates
tidygate_env$gates |>
  head()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Save if needed
tidygate_env$gates |>
  write_rds("important_gates.rds")
```

If previously drawn gates are supplied to the `programmatic_gates` argument, points will be gated programmatically. This feature allows the reproduction of previously drawn interactive gates.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
important_gates <-
  read_rds("important_gates.rds")

mtcars |>
  mutate(gated = gate(x = mpg, y = wt, programmatic_gates = important_gates)) |>
  filter(!is.na(gated))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mtcars |>
  mutate(gated = gate(x = mpg, y = wt, programmatic_gates = tidygate_env$gates)) |>
  filter(!is.na(gated))
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
